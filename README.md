# 🔍 Employee Attrition Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📖 Problem Statement
This project aims to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (attrition) based on various factors like job satisfaction, monthly income, years of experience, work environment, and other HR-related data. Early prediction of employee attrition can help organizations take preventive actions to retain valuable employees.
